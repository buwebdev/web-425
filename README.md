## Course Description

Learn Angular with TypeScript by building real-world applications.  This course covers web application frameworks and how to build client-rich applications using Angular with TypeScript.  Following an intensive, hands-on style format, students will learn how to write code in TypeScript, communicate with middleware platforms using HTTP and WebSocket protocols, automate the building and deployment processes using the Angular CLI, organizing navigation in a Single Page Application (SPAs), learn industry best practices, unit-testing, and deployment.  GitHub is used to host and share coding projects.

Prerequisite: None

## Repository Overview

Carefully read the assigned chapters, videos, and narrative I've included under each exercise and assignment.

Most exercises and assignments have runnable sample code so you can visually see the concept "in action."  Assignments are broken into "milestones" and each "milestone" builds on the last.

Approach every week from top-to-bottom and do not move to the next assignment/exercise without fully understanding the previous.
